# Considerations #
Some stuff to have in mind before starting:
  1. This library works **always** with pd in edit mode. So, if you don't want crash your program, don't change it.
  1. Untill this version, it's **not recommended** to create two boxes too near (in x-y position) one from other. This is very important if you don't want to bug your program. This happens due to the manner Pyata was built, based on the position of the boxes on the patch that runs on Pd. So make sure to create boxes keeping a good distance between them.
  1. The library is still in beta phase. So if you find a bug, please, let me know.

# Still before starting... #
Before using, you have to install Pyata. You can find how to do it [here](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/How_To_Install).

# Quick tutorial! #

This tutorial is quite simple. It will create an oscilator ("osc~") and a digital-analogic converter ("dac~"), connecting them. The image above shows the final result. You can find further informations of classes, methods and what you can do with them reading the [Pd](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Pd), [Box](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Box), [Object](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Object), [Number](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Number), [Message](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Message), [Symbol](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Symbol), [Comment](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Comment) and [Others](http://code.google.com/p/pyata/wiki/Others), API specification.
